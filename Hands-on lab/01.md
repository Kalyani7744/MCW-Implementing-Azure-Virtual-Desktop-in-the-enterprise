## Exercise 1: Configuring Azure AD Connect with AD DS

Duration:  60 minutes

In this exercise, you will be configuring [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect). With Azure Virtual Desktop, all session host VMs within the AVD tenant environment are required to be domain joined to AD DS, and the domain must be synchronized with Azure AD. To manage the synchronization of objects, you will configure Azure AD Connect on the domain controller deployed in Azure.

>**Note**: RDP access to a domain controller using a public IP address is not a best practice and is only done to simplify this lab. Better security practices such as removing the PIP, enabling just-in-time access and/or leveraging a bastion host should be applied enhance security.

### Task 1: Connecting to the domain controller

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Type **Resource groups** in the search field and select it from the list.

3.  On the Resource groups blade, select the resource group name that you created in the **Before the HOL** template deployment.

4.  On the Infra Resource group blade, review the list of available resources. Locate the resource named **AdPubIP1** and select it. Note that the resource type should be **Public IP address**.

    ![This image shows how to find the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](images/publicip.png "Public IP address for Domain Controller VM")

5.  On the Overview page for AdPubIP1, locate the **IP address** field. Copy the IP address to a safe location.

6.  On your local machine, open the **RUN** dialog window, type **MSTSC** and enter.

    ![This image shows the Run dialog window to run MSTSC.](images/run.png "Run on Windows") 

7.  In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste in the public IP address from the previous step. Select **Connect**.

    ![This image shows how the Window for Remote Desktop Connection will open to enter the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](images/remoteDesktop.png "Window for Remote Desktop Connection") 

8.  When prompted, sign in with the following credentials.
- Username: **ADadmin**
- password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**
- When prompted, select **Yes** to accept the RDP certification warning.

### Task 2: Disabling IE Enhanced Security

To simplify tasks in this lab, we will start by disabling [IE Enhanced Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-ie-esc).

1.  Once connected to the domain controller, open Server Manager if it does not start automatically.

2.  In Server Manager, select **Local Server** on the left.

3.  Locate the **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** option and select **On**.

    ![This image shows the Local Server properties in server manager, locate Enhanced Security configuration.](images/IEESC.png "Local Server properties within server manager") 

4.  On the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration window, under **Administrators**, select the **Off** radio button and select **OK**.

    ![This image shows how you select the current configuration, a new window will open that will allow you to disable the enhanced security configuration.](images/disablesecurity.png "Disable enhanced security configuration")

### Task 3: Creating a domain admin account

By default, Azure AD Connect does not synchronize the built-in domain administrator account [ADAdmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:ADAdmin@MyADDomain.com). This system account has the attribute isCriticalSystemObject set to *true*, preventing it from being synchronized. While it is possible to modify this, it is not a best practice to do so.

1.  In Server Manager, select **Tools** in the upper right corner and select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![This image shows how to find Tools on the upper right corner to access the Server Manager Tools.](images/serverMangerTools.png "Server Manager Tools") 

2.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click the **Users** organization unit and select **New \> User** from the menu.

    ![In this image, you find the folder path for users, and right-click to add a new user.](images/newUser.png "Folder path for new user") 

3.  Complete the New User wizard.

    ![This image shows the window that will open with the fields to complete for a new user.](images/newuserobject.png "Create a new user")

    ![This image is the next window that will allow you to assign a password.](images/newUserWizard.png "New User Wizard window") 

    ![This image shows the final screen of the wizard will allow you to review and finish the new user setup.](images/finishnewuser.png "Finish new user setup")

    >**Note**: This account will be important in future tasks. Make a note of the username and password you create. When setting the password, uncheck the box **User must change password at next logon**.

4.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click on the new user account object and select **Add to a group**.

    ![This image shows when the new user is created, we will find that username and right-click to add the user to a group.](images/addusertogroup.png "Add new user to a group")

5.  On the Select Groups dialog window, type **Domain Admins** and select **OK**.
   
    >**Note**: This account will be used during the host pool creation process for joining the hosts to the domain. Granting Domain Admin permissions will simplify the lab. However, any Active Directory account that has the following permissions will suffice. This can be done using [Active Directory Delegate Control](https://danielengberg.com/domain-join-permissions-delegate-active-directory/). 

    ![This image shows how we will add this user to the Domain Admins group.](images/addusertodomainadmins.png "Add user to Domain Admins group")

### Task 4: Configuring Azure AD Connect

1.  On the desktop of the domain controller, locate the icon for **Azure AD Connect** and open it.

    ![This image shows the Azure AD Connect icon on the Domain controller VM desktop.](images/azureadconnect.png "Azure AD Connect desktop icon")

2.  Accept the license terms and privacy notice, then select continue. On the next screen select **Use express settings**. The required components will install.

    ![This image shows how the install wizard will take you to the Azure AD connect set up screen.](images/AzureADconnectExpressSetting.png "Azure AD connect set up screen") 

3.  On the Connect to Azure AD page, enter in the Azure AD Global Admin credentials. For example: [azadmin\@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:azadmin@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com) and the correct password. Select **Next**.

    ![This image shows how after selecting "Use express settings", the next window will require you to enter your Azure Active Directory username and password.](images/adconnectazuresub.png "Azure AD Connect - Azure AD login")
    >**Note**: This is the account associated with your Azure subscription.

4.  On the Connect to AD DS page, enter in the Active Directory credentials for a Domain Admin account. For example, when you used the ARM template deployment for the domain controller, the credentials will be something along the lines of: **[[MyADDomain.com]](http://myaddomain.com/) \\ADadmin** with the password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. Select **Next**.

    ![This image shows the next window, where you will enter the AD DS domain and admin username and password.](images/azureadconnectdclogin.png "Azure AD Connect - Domain login")
    
    >**Note**: When you copy and paste the password, make sure there are no trailing spaces, as that will cause the verification to fail.

5.  Select **Install** to start the configuration and synchronization.

    ![This image shows the next window, where you will select the box to continue without matching all UPN suffixes and select next to continue.](images/azureadsigninconfig.png "Azure AD sign-in configuration")

    ![This image shows the final setup window, select the box to start the synchronization process and select install.](images/azureadready.png "Azure AD Connect Ready to configure")

6.  After a few minutes, the Azure AD Connect installation will complete. Select **Exit**.

    ![This image shows the installation is complete the Configuration complete window will be present.](images/AADCcomplete.png "The Configuration is completed window")
    
7.  Minimize the RDP session for the domain controller and wait a few minutes for the AD accounts to be synchronized to Azure AD.

8.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

9.  Type **Azure Active Directory** in the search field and select it from the list.

10. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**, select **Users**.

11. Review the list of user account objects and confirm the test accounts have synchronized.  

    ![This image shows the list of users that you should see in Azure Active Directory that were synchronized from Active Directory with Azure AD Connect.](images/adconnectsync.png "Synchronized users list")

    >**Note**: It can take up to 15 minutes for the Active Directory objects to be synchronized to the Azure AD tenant.
